Easy Matplotlib Graph For Windows
Notes For End Users:
Matplotlib Graph For Windows Using TK Backend.
There Are Several Methods That May Be Used To Configure The Graph.
The Provided Menus Offer Almost All Properties For Configuration before
Executing Your Code From The Test Menu. Another Way Is To Setup All The
tk Variables Found In (set_defaults()) Before Runtime Or Setup These Variables
In Your Code And Then Executing (set_axes()) Prior To Drawing. You Will Find Some
Existing Functions That I Created Just To Make Things Easier To Change With
Code During Runtime. View The Examples Provided For These Functions. Of Course
You May Add More Functions Or Just Use Standard matplotlib Procedures For Change.
The Class (Test) Provides Place Holders For Test Menu Items And Test Code.
