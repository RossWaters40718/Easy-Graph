Matplotlib Graph For Windows Using Tkinter backend_tkagg.
This Code Is For Windows Operating System Only. You May Make
Modifications For Other Operating Systems If You Wish. 
Graph Setup Methods:
	1. Use The Provided Menus To Configure The Graph.
	2. Save The Configuration As A Plot File And Load To Graph At Any Time.
	3. Configure Graph With Code.
	4. Asign Values To TK Variables Located In set_defaults() And Then Run set_axes() 
	
# There Exist Some Functions That I Created Just To Make Things Easier To Change With
# Code During Runtime. View The Examples Provided For These Functions. Of Course
# You May Add More Functions Or Just Use Standard matplotlib Procedures For Change.
# The Class (Test) Provides Place Holders For Test Menu Items And Test Code.  
# If X And Y Data Are In Lists Or Numpy Arrays, There Are 2 Plotting Types. Loop Or Instant.
# X And Y Values Must Be In Their Own Seperate List Or Numpy Array. If Not Then Modification Is Required.
# Each Test Function Has 3 Choices For Plotting ('loop', 'instant'. 'live').
# Set Argument Test.log('loop'),Test.log('instant'),Test.log('live') When Calling The Function.
# The Argument int (plt_num) Is Used To Reset For A New Plot. For Each Time A New Plot Sequence
# On The Same Graph, Increment plt_num by 1. This Is Necessary For Loading Plot Data To Graph.
# The str(color,style,width) Arguments Are Basically Matplotlib Std For plt.plot().
# All Plotted Values Are Located In List (Plot_Data) Until Cleared By Function clear_graph().
# If You Wish To Save The Plot Data, You Must Do So Before Calling clear_graph() Function. 
# These Values (Plot_Data) Can Be Saved To Text Files Before Clearing In Configure Viewport Menu
# Or Being Cleared By Starting A New Test (clear_graph()) Function.
# Always Call clear_graph() Function 'Only' At The Beginning Of A New Test.
# Graph Configuration And/Or Plot Data May Be Saved To A Plot File.
